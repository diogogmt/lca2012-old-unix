Matt's notes.  Staging area for readying into real plan (TM).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things to investigate:

-       Can I compile the world with busybox?  Dietlibc?  Can I make a usable
        linux "distro" this way?  Can I use this for a week or two without going
        bonkers?

-	asmutils! http://asm.sourceforge.net//asmutils.html
	ls is x86-only and 1018 bytes.

-	Sourcecode comparisons (size, functionality)
	   - Orig unix
	   - Linux coreutils/busybox
	   - NetBSD?  Fairly "old/original" and minimal?
	   - Minix?

	   ls, cat, wc, find, cksum

-	Argument of "Internationalisation"

-	Argument of "Portability" -- asmutils clearly fails this one, but does 
	busybox compile on BSD?  On Solaris?

- 	My x86 Ubuntu /bin/ls is 105K (97K text, 3K BSS, 1K rodata and the rest
	ELF guff).
	Use Valgrind -- how much of its 105K is actually ever accessed for the
	common cases* of "ls" and "ls -l"?

	Could augment PDP11 emul to do the same [done now]; have a "value" metric to
	compare how much of the binaries are used on each platform?

	(Build argument/investigation here illustrating "what the binary could
	do" versus "what you use it for 99% of the time".)

	*: Define "common cases"; useful switches, subjective "non-obscure" stuff,
	common error paths.

- 	I keep finding obscure features in common binaries.  How much does this cost?
         (This and the above come back to busybox, which does only the bare
         minimum. I may well be happy with just that, as I don't use most odd
         features.)

-	retrobsd:
	Port of 2BSD to PIC32 (MIPS32) microcontrollers!  Good, as v. close to
	Olden Unix and easily buildable/emulatable on Linux!  Build statically links
	binaries to ELF, then elf2aouts them.  Binaries are surprisingly large
	given the simple source!  (I think suffers from libc too.) E.g. 'cat' source
	is v.v.v.simple, (c) Regents 1980, 217 lines, and:
	   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
	  19832     744     208   20784    5130 cat.elf

Random stats:

-       Diet libc helloworld is 2K.  Glibc (x86 Ubuntu) version is 7K.

- 	x86 busybox static = 1269432 (which libc?)  x86 busybox dynamic w/ glibc =
	687260 x86 busybox + dietlibc .. nontrivial to compile. might be interesting
	though.

-   	Extreme test: "int main(void) { return 42; }"  Two x86 instructions.
	7K as shared ELF, 5.5K stripped.  ~1.2K in LOAD sections, rest things
	like dynamic linky tables/symbols, etc.
	500K as static ELF (!!! I don't call any fns!  (But preamble to main()
	does on my behalf.)
	
	The .o (unlinked) is 670 bytes;	ELF header is 0x34 bytes, text 10 bytes,
	.comment 0x24 bytes. Then, 572 bytes of crap: what is this?  DWARF stuff
	perhaps?
	
	Is there a --strip-unused-functions linker flag that could be used
	to prune down the 500K static size? (It SHOULD ALREADY do this!!  I
	made a test .a with three .o, two dependent, and linked against this
	with a simple main().  When calling the independent function, the other
	.o files were stripped away!)

Performance:
-	Statically link bash
	- diet libc
	- normal libc
	Test invocation time (x 10000); should be faster w/o dynlinking

-	Openoffice is a good example of something that does a huge amount
	of PLT fixup -- esp. if we LD_BIND_NOW it.

Questions:
-	Why is static-linked hello world 500K? :(  This is bad. (I'm sure I once
	saw a system/linker that stripped unused functions (probably dropped whole
	.o modules (if they were wholly untouched) from the .a libraries linked),
	wouldn't it be cool if GNU ld did that?  I cannot believe that helloworld
	and its dependencies actually covers 500K of stuff.  Even with glibc.

-	Why is dynamic-linked hello world 7K? :((  This is worse.  It's only supposed
	to now contain a couple of stubs saying "I use libc.so" and PLT entries
	for printf, exit, etc.
