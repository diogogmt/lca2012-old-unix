To get an unsigned variable, they used a char *.
No '=' for initialization of declared vars outside function.
=| and =& instead of |=, &=.
No checking of structure member names, eg:
	int x;
	struct { char dminor, dmajor;};
	x.dminor = 7;
Also, used to treat pointer as integer (exact addition).
end is symbol for end of text; sbrk() used instead of malloc.
